Multimodal Price Prediction using Text + Images + Stacking Ensembles
This repository contains my complete solution for the ML Challenge 2025 – Smart Product Pricing, where the goal is to build a model capable of predicting product prices using only product text, catalog descriptions, and product images, without any external data or price lookup.
The task involves 150,000 products (75k train + 75k test) and requires a robust multimodal regression model.
My final solution is a hybrid ensemble system that uses text embeddings + TF-IDF + image embeddings + gradient boosting models combined through a stacking meta-model.
